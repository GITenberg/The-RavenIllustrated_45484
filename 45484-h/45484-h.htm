      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>NCE upon a
      midnight dreary,
    </p>
    <p>
      While I pondered, weak and weary,
    </p>
    <p>
      Over many a quaint and curious
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Volume of forgotten lore&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      While I nodded, nearly napping,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Suddenly there came a tapping,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      As of some one gently rapping,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Rapping at my chamber door.
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis some visitor,&rdquo; I muttered,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Tapping at my chamber door&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Only this and nothing more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Ah, distinctly I remember
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      It was in the bleak December,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And each separate dying ember
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Wrought its ghost upon the floor.
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Eagerly I wished the morrow;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Vainly I had tried to borrow
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      From my books surcease of sorrow&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Sorrow for the lost Lenore&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      For the rare and radiant maiden
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Whom the angels name Lenore&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Nameless here for evermore.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And the silken, sad uncertain
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Rustling of each purple curtain
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Thrilled me&mdash;filled me with fantastic
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Terrors never felt before;
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      So that now, to still the beating
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Of my heart, I stood repeating,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis some visitor entreating
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Entrance at my chamber door&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Some late visitor entreating
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Entrance at my chamber door;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      This it is and nothing more.&rdquo;

    <p class="indent10">
      Presently my soul
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      grew stronger;
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Hesitating then
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      no longer,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said I,

    <p class="indent10">
      Your forgiveness

    <p class="indent30">
      I implore;
    </p>

      But the fact is
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      I was napping,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And so gently you
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      came rapping,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And so faintly
    </p>
    <p class="indent300">
      you came tapping,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Tapping at my
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      chamber door,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      That I scarce was sure
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      I heard you&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Here I opened
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      wide the door:
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Darkness there and
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      nothing more.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Deep into that darkness peering,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Long I stood there, wondering, fearing,
    </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Ever dared to dream before;
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      But the silence was unbroken,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And the darkness gave no token,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      And the only word there spoken
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Was the whispered word, &ldquo;Lenore?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent5">
      This I whispered, and an echo
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Murmured back the word, &ldquo;Lenore!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Merely this and nothing more.

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or

1.B.  &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark.  It may only be

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; associated with or appearing on the

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo;, WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
