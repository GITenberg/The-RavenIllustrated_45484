description: One of the most famous and widely read poems, "The Raven" was first published
  by Edgar Allan Poe in 1845. With its trademark, musical verse and repetitive language,
  Poe's narrative poem sees a distressed lover and his mysterious avian visitor, all
  the while building tension and dread as the poem progresses. Quoth the raven, "nevermore!"
